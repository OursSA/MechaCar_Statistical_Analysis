## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The linear regression on the cars' MPG values produced the following output:

From the regression, it appears that the length of the vehicle and the ground clearance of the vehicle each have a statistically significant effect on MPG.

The slope of the linear regression is not considered to be zero, because the p-value associated with the F statistic is on the order of 10 ^ -11.

The regression gave an R^2 value of 0.71, meaning that the model accounts for about 70% of the variation in MPG. This indicates that it is reasonably effective in predicting the MPG of the prototypes.
